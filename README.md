# CIS-520 Project on Pcard Fraud Detection Analysis

>> The goal of this project is to develop a data visualization platform to analyze transactional data for Purchase Cards (P-Cards) in educational  institutions and identify cases of potential fraud and control breaches.

>> Our analysis could be useful for internal auditors to perform continuous monitoring and audit of Purchase Card transactions and also enable them to adopt a diagnostic approach rather than reactive approach.

>> Transactional Data for Purchase Card (P-Card) which spans through the financial years 2013-2015.

>> This data-set contains information on purchases, made through the purchase card program administered by the state and higher education institutions.
